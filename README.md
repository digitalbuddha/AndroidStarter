AndroidStarter
==============

10/31/2014 -  There is a "Square Stack" version this project that uses  Retrofit and Dagger while removing Volley
https://github.com/digitalbuddha/DaggerStarter



This project is an opinionated view of how to painlessly program in android
Challenges this project solves:
*  Background jobs/threading - Priority Job Queue (Path)
*  Networking - Volley
*  Messaging between background threads and UI Thread through config changes - EventBus (Green Robot)
*  Fast JSON marhshalling/unmarshalling - Gson
*  Make code pretty and stuff - ButterKnife (Square)
*  Testing with Roboelectric (install 'Android Unit Test' Android Studio plugin to enable tests to be run by right clicking them)

#Othere interesting elements
* Gradle build
* Recycler View
* Animations




Any and all feedback is greatly apprecated
